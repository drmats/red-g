## ok, what's in here and how to use it?

1. actions as non-const enums (example `app/action_type.ts` file):
    ```typescript
    export enum AppActionType {
        RESET = "App/RESET",
        READY = "App/READY",
        NOT_READY = "App/NOT_READY",
        DELAYED = "App/DELAYED",
        CLEAR_ERROR = "App/CLEAR_ERROR",
    }
    ```

2. easy action creators - define only those carrying some payload, empty
    ones are defined automatically (example `app/action.ts` file):
    ```typescript
    import { actionCreators } from "red-g";
    import { AppActionType } from "./action_type";

    export default actionCreators(AppActionType, {
        READY: (error?: string) => ({ error }),
        DELAYED: (condition: boolean) => ({ condition }),
    });
    ```

3. slice of state (`app/state.ts`):
    ```typescript
    export default {
        // usual stuff
        ready: false,
        delayed: false,

        // last application error - example use
        // of "type predicate" matcher
        // (matching actions by payload content)
        error: null as string | null,

        // how many actions of this type
        // has been spawned? - somewhat artificial
        // example of "boolean" matcher usage
        // (matching actions using string
        // operations on their type)
        actionCount: 0,
    };
    ```

4. fantastic slice reducers (example `app/reducer.ts` file) with matchers:
    ```typescript
    import type { Action } from "red-g";
    import {
        isStringActionType,
        isWithPayload,
        sliceReducer,
    } from "red-g";
    import initState from "./state";
    import app from "./action";

    export default sliceReducer(initState) (
        (slice) => slice
            .handle(app.RESET, () => initState)

            // this action can carry `error` payload
            // but we're not interested in it (for now)
            .handle(app.READY, (state) => ({
                ...state, ready: true,
            })

            // this action is not carrying any payload
            // and was automatically defined by
            // call to `actionCreators()`
            .handle(app.NOT_READY, (state) => ({
                ...state, ready: false,
            })

            // this action is carrying simple payload and we can
            // destructure it immediately
            .handle(app.DELAYED, (state, { condition }) => ({
                ...state, delayed: condition,
            })

            // same situation as with `app.NOT_READY`
            // (shown here for completness of the example)
            .handle(app.CLEAR_ERROR, (state) => ({
                ...state, error: null,
            })

            // match all actions that carry payload with
            // `error` key ("type predicate" matcher)
            .match(
                (action): action is Action<{ error: string }> =>
                    isWithPayload(action) && action.payload.error,
                (state, { error }) => ({
                    ...state, error,
                }),
            )

            // match all actions whose `type` field starts with
            // `App/` prefix ("boolean" matcher)
            .match(
                (action) =>
                    isStringActionType(action) &&
                        action.type.startsWith("App/"),
                (state) => ({
                    ...state, actionCount: state.actionCount + 1,
                }),
            ),
    );
    ```

5. now, you can combine all of your slice reducers (and actions and thunks...)
    into nice trees (as you do usually) - example `state_logic.ts` file:
    ```typescript
    import appAction from "./app/action";
    import appReducer from "./app/reducer";

    export const action = {
        app: appAction,
        // ... and others
    };

    export const reducer = {
        app: appReducer,
        // ... and others
    };
    ```

6. slice reducers are compatible with regular redux flow:
    ```typescript
    import {
        createStore,
        combineReducers,
    } from "redux";
    import {
        bindActionCreatorsTree,
    } from "red-g";
    import {
        action,
        reducer,
    } from "./state_logic";

    const rootReducer = combineReducers(reducer);

    // redux store creation
    const store = createStore(
        rootReducer,
        // ... and other usual stuff
    );

    // bound actions tree
    const act = bindActionCreatorsTree(
        action, store.dispatch,
    );
    ```


There's more to be happy about if you use

## can I use [immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/)?

Sure! [Curried producers](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/curried-produce)
are supported out of the box:

```typescript
import type { Action } from "red-g";
import {
    isWithPayload,
    sliceReducer,
} from "red-g";
import produce from "immer";
import initState from "./state";
import app from "./action";

export default sliceReducer(initState) (
    (slice) => slice
        .handle(app.RESET, () => initState)

        .handle(app.READY, produce((draft) => {
            draft.ready = true;
        })

        .handle(app.DELAYED, produce((draft, { condition }) => {
            draft.delayed = condition;
        })

        .match(
            (action): action is Action<{ error: string }> =>
                isWithPayload(action) && action.payload.error,
            produce((draft, payload) => {
                draft.error = payload.error;
            }),
        ),
);
```
